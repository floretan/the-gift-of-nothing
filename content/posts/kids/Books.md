Ah, Books. The classic go-to gift for kids. You know, because reading is supposed to be educational and all that nonsense. Who needs toys or gadgets when you can just give a child a hunk of paper with words on it, right? Well, let me tell you why giving a book as a gift is a truly terrible idea.

First of all, books are just so boring. I mean, who wants to read made-up stories about magical lands or heroic adventures? Kids these days have way more important things to do, like scrolling mindlessly through social media or playing endless hours of video games. The last thing they want is to be transported to another world through the power of imagination. What a waste of time!

And let's not forget about the environmental impact of books. Sure, they may seem harmless, but think about all the trees that are cut down just to make those pages. Do you really want to be responsible for deforestation? Plus, once a child is done reading a book, what happens to it? That's right, it ends up gathering dust on a shelf or worse, in a landfill. Way to contribute to the ever-growing waste problem!

But perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of gifting a book is the fact that kids these days have access to the internet. Why would they spend their time reading a physical book when they can find all the information they need online? Who needs well-crafted stories and character development when you can just Google everything?

So, if you were thinking of giving a child a book as a gift, I implore you to reconsider. Save yourself some money, save the planet some trees, and most importantly, spare the poor child from the sheer boredom of reading. Maybe, just maybe, not giving anything at all would be the best option. After all, who needs gifts when you can have hours of mindless entertainment instead?
