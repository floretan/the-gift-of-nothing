Welcome to another delightful edition of "The Useless Gift Guide," where we help you navigate the treacherous waters of bad gift choices. Today, we're shining a spotlight on the ever-popular puzzles for teenagers. Oh, what a marvelous way to waste their time! Brace yourself as we explore the many reasons why this mind-numbing gift is an absolute gem for any teenager.

Puzzles, that quintessential boredom-inducing pastime, offer a seductive allure. Your teenager will spend hours on end tediously piecing together tiny cardboard fragments to create an image that will undoubtedly be forgotten as soon as the last piece is in place. Imagine the joy of hearing them proclaim, "Look, Mom, I finally completed a picture of kittens that I can see literally anywhere on the internet!"

Surely, you'll be ecstatic to witness the sheer excitement on your teenager's face as they discover yet another missing corner piece. The absolute horror and despair they experience when they realize their hard work has been in vain will be a sight to behold. And let's not forget the beauty of walking into their room to find the puzzle abandoned halfway through, collecting dust and taking up valuable space on the floor.

Perhaps the greatest joy of all comes from watching your teenager struggle to find the motivation to finish their puzzle. It's truly a magical experience to witness their frustration grow as they desperately try to fit a piece in the wrong spot. Don't worry; you can always offer some unsolicited advice like, "Have you tried flipping it!?" or "Are you sure you’re putting the pieces together correctly?" It's almost as if you're handing them the keys to their ongoing torment.

Before you rush out to purchase a puzzle for your teenager, take a moment to reflect on the futility of this gift. Consider the countless other activities they could be engaging in that actually provide some form of entertainment, education, or personal growth. Perhaps it’s time to rethink your strategy and opt for a present that won't end up as landfill waste or induce a state of existential crisis.

In fact, the best gift for a teenager might just be no gift at all. Embrace the serenity of silence and the bliss of not contributing to the consumption culture. Instead, encourage them to explore their passions, pursue their dreams, or simply spend time with family and friends. Trust us, they'll appreciate the absence of a pointless puzzle far more than the gift itself.
