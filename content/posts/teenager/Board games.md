Board games. Ah, the perfect gift for a teenager, right? Wrong! Let's face it, board games are a terrible choice when it comes to finding the perfect present for those moody adolescents in your life. Here's why:

First of all, board games are so old-fashioned! I mean, come on, who wants to sit around a table with family or friends, laughing and strategizing when there are smartphones and video games to entertain us? Why would any teenager want to engage in something that requires interaction and social skills when they can just swipe their way through life on a screen?

Secondly, board games are a breeding ground for arguments and drama. Have you ever witnessed a game of Monopoly where everyone stays calm and collected? Exactly. Board games have the uncanny ability to turn even the most mature teenagers into raging competitors, arguing over who gets to be the top hat or accusing each other of cheating. Do you really want to contribute to that chaos?

Another reason to avoid board games is their limited playability. Sure, they might seem fun at first, but how many times can you go around the same game board before boredom sets in? Teenagers have short attention spans, and after a few rounds, that shiny new board game will be gathering dust on a shelf, forgotten and unloved.

Not to mention the environmental impact of board games. Most of them are made from plastic and other non-biodegradable materials, which end up in landfills when discarded. Do we really want to contribute to the overwhelming amount of waste in this world by gifting something that will eventually just add to the pollution problem?

Now, before you rush out to buy a board game as a last-minute gift, think again. Perhaps the best gift you can give a teenager is the freedom to choose their own form of entertainment. Maybe they would enjoy a gift card, giving them the opportunity to buy something they truly want. Or better yet, why not spend quality time with them doing something they love? Because in the end, the most valuable gift we can give is our time and attention.

So, let's reconsider board games as a gift for teenagers. Perhaps it's time to move away from the old-fashioned and embrace the new. And if you can't find a suitable alternative, remember that sometimes, not giving anything at all might just be the best option.
