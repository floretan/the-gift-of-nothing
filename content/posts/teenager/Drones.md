Hey there, fellow conscious consumers! In our ongoing quest to save the planet from unnecessary waste, we present to you another gem from our "Useless Teenage Gift Guide." Today, we're going to tackle the oh-so-popular and oh-so-useless gift: Drones!

1. **Flying towards disaster:** Ah, drones, the must-have accessory for every teenager. Because who needs the joy of playing outdoors or interacting with real humans when you can sit inside and operate a noisy flying machine? Forget about social skills and fresh air – drones have got your teenager covered!

2. **Noisy neighbors:** Have you ever wondered what it would be like to have a swarm of angry bees constantly buzzing around your house? Well, introducing drones – the perfect answer to that question! With their incessant buzzing and whirring, they'll provide an auditory experience like no other, driving both you and your neighbors to the brink of insanity. What a splendid gift, indeed.

3. **Beyond your control:** Let's face it, teenagers are known for their impeccable decision-making skills and responsible behavior. So why not give them a gift that will enable them to pilot an unregulated flying machine with minimal training or experience? What could possibly go wrong? Say hello to aerial accidents and lost drones, which will surely bring joy and excitement to your teenager's life.

4. **Environmental havoc:** Drones are not only useless, but they're also harmful to the environment. These battery-operated pests guzzle energy faster than your teenager can devour a bag of chips. Plus, let's not forget the potential hazards of crashing into trees, buildings, or unsuspecting wildlife. Because who doesn't love the idea of contributing to the destruction of our delicate ecosystem?

5. **The gift of nothing:** As a responsible consumer, we would be remiss if we didn't suggest an alternative to flying nuisances like drones. So here's our radical proposal – how about not giving anything at all? Instead of cluttering up our world with pointless gadgets, embrace the beauty of minimalism and encourage experiences over material possessions. Maybe a heartfelt letter, a day spent together, or a simple act of kindness might be the best "gift" you can provide.

There you have it, folks – another item added to our Useless Teenage Gift Guide. Drones may be all the rage, but let's remember that they offer little more than noise, environmental damage, and an invitation for trouble. So why not consider alternatives that promote connection, creativity, and sustainability? Your teenager, and the planet, will thank you!
