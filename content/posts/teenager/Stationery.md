title: "The Uselessness of Stationery as a Teenager's Gift"
---

Oh, stationery, the classic yet utterly useless gift for a teenager. What better way to show your love and affection than with a pack of colorful pens and fancy notebooks? Well, let me tell you why stationery is the epitome of a gift that will end up in the darkest depths of a landfill.

First and foremost, let's address the fact that teenagers these days are glued to their electronic devices. They rarely write anything by hand anymore. So, giving them stationery is like handing a caveman a smartphone. It's utterly pointless and will probably just collect dust in a forgotten drawer.

Moreover, let's talk about the environmental impact of stationery. Those pens and markers are usually made of plastic, which we all know is terrible for our planet. The production of plastic releases greenhouse gases and, worst of all, it takes hundreds of years for plastic to decompose. So, congratulations, you've just contributed to the ever-growing plastic pollution crisis.

But wait, there's more! Do you really think a teenager wants to spend their precious time jotting down notes in a fancy notebook when they could be binge-watching their favorite shows or scrolling mindlessly through social media? The answer is a resounding no. Stationery simply doesn't fit into their fast-paced, digital lives.

Now, let's address the elephant in the room â€“ the cost. Stationery, especially the trendy ones, can be quite expensive. Sure, that shiny set of glitter pens might catch your eye, but is it really worth the hefty price tag? You could probably buy a month's worth of streaming subscriptions with that money. Just saying.

In conclusion, my dear gift-giver, stationery is an outdated and wasteful choice for a teenager's present. Instead of contributing to the ever-growing pile of useless stuff, consider giving them an experience, a heartfelt conversation, or even just some cold hard cash. And if you're really stumped for ideas, remember that sometimes giving nothing at all might be the most environmentally friendly option.
