Ah, the teenage years - a time of rebellion, angst, and a never-ending desire for useless stuff. But fear not, dear readers, for we are here to navigate the treacherous waters of teenage gifting, offering you a satirical and fact-based guide to ensure that your presents don't end up adding to the ever-growing pile of landfill waste. Today, we delve into the world of bicycles and why they make the perfect terrible gift for a teenager.

1. **Bicycles are so last century.** Seriously, who needs a bicycle when you can hop on the latest electric scooters or hoverboards? Your teenager will undoubtedly scoff at the outdated technology and lack of coolness that a bicycle brings. Plus, who wants to pedal when they can simply push a button and be effortlessly whisked away?

2. **It's all about the car, baby.** Dream big, right? In the teenage mind, freedom comes in the form of a driver's license and the promise of cruising around in their very own car. Handing them a bicycle will shatter those dreams faster than you can say "bike bell." Save yourself the disappointment on both sides and don't bother with a two-wheeled contraption that pales in comparison.

3. **The world is their oyster - until they get tired.** Riding a bicycle may seem like a great way for teenagers to explore the world and get some exercise, but let's be real here. Teenagers are famously known for their lack of motivation and their ability to get tired by simply walking up a flight of stairs. Do you think they'll be pedaling for miles on end? Spoiler alert: they won't.

4. **Safety first, or not.** When was the last time you saw a teenager willingly wear a helmet? That's right - never. And don't even get us started on their disregard for traffic rules. Giving a teenager a bicycle is like handing them a one-way ticket to a hospital visit. Not only will you be contributing to their rebellious spirit, but also to the number of unnecessary accidents on the road.

5. **The gift of nothingness.** As we conclude our satirical look at why bicycles are a terrible gift for a teenager, we'd like to offer an alternative solution - don't give them anything. While it may seem unconventional, sometimes the best gift you can give a teenager is the opportunity to choose something they truly want or to save the planet by not cluttering it with more unnecessary junk. Who knew nothing could be so valuable?

So, dear readers, before you make the decision to gift a bicycle to your teenage loved ones, we implore you to reconsider. Save yourself the disappointment and landfill space, and opt for a present that will truly bring joy and purpose. Or better yet, let them choose for themselves. Trust us, they'll thank you later.
