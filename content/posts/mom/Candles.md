Ah, candles, the go-to gift for every occasion. It's almost as if people think that moms have an obsession with setting the mood or desperately need to mask unpleasant aromas. Well, brace yourself, because I'm about to burst your bubble. Candles are one of the most useless gifts you can get for a mom, and here's why:

1. **They're just decorative.** Sure, candles can look pretty, but let's face it, moms have enough to do without worrying about adding extra decor to their homes. They've got dishes to wash, laundry to fold, and children to chase after. The last thing they need is another item gathering dust on a shelf.

2. **Safety risk galore.** Candles are basically tiny open flames waiting to cause havoc. With kids running around, it's like playing a never-ending game of "fire hazard roulette." Moms already have enough stress to deal with – they don't need to worry about constantly monitoring a potential fire hazard too.

3. **The scent game is tricky.** I get it; candles are often marketed as stress-relievers with heavenly scents. But let's be real, finding the perfect scent is no easy task. What if she ends up with a candle that smells like a mix of unicorn tears and mothballs? Trust me, she won't appreciate that.

4. **Environmental nightmare.** Most candles are made from paraffin wax, which is derived from petroleum. So not only are they unnecessary, but they also contribute to pollution when burned. The Earth is already dealing with enough human-induced problems – let's not add to the situation with useless gifts.

5. **A waste of money.** Candles can be ridiculously expensive for what they are. Honestly, why spend money on something that will be burned away within a few hours, leaving nothing but a melted mess behind? Save your money and put it towards something that will actually bring joy and value to a mom's life.

Before you rush out to buy a candle for a mom in your life, take a moment to reconsider. A candle may seem like a thoughtful present, but in reality, it's just a thoughtless addition to already cluttered homes. And guess what? Not giving anything might just be the best gift of all – it's one less thing for her to deal with.
