Hey there, gift-givers! Welcome to our Useless Gift Guide, where we expose all the pointless presents that end up in landfills. Today, we're here to talk about the oh-so-popular gift for dads: leather gloves. 

First of all, let's address the elephant in the room: leather gloves? Really? Sure, they might be seen as a classic gift, but let's be honest, when was the last time you saw dear old dad wearing a pair of leather gloves? Unless he's secretly moonlighting as a stylish assassin or hangs out with a clique of flamboyant magicians, those gloves are most likely to gather dust in the back of his closet.

Now, you might argue that leather gloves are practical for those cold winter days or for his occasional landscaping chores. But here's the thing - leather gloves for dad are about as useful as a screen door on a submarine. Sure, they might keep his hands warm, but how often does he really need them? Plus, there are plenty of affordable alternatives out there that serve the exact same purpose without the unnecessary animal exploitation.

Let's not forget the environmental impact of leather gloves. The leather industry is notorious for its harmful effects on the environment, from deforestation to water pollution. So, not only will your dad probably never wear them, but these gloves also contribute to the destruction of our planet. 

Ultimately, and we can't stress this enough, maybe the best gift for dad is no gift at all. Instead of wasting your hard-earned money on something he won't use, why not spend quality time with him or simply express your love and appreciation? Trust us, he'll appreciate that more than a pair of redundant leather gloves any day.

So, next time you're hunting for a gift for dad, skip the useless leather gloves. They're an unnecessary expense that harms the environment and will likely end up forgotten in a drawer. Save your money, save the planet, and focus on what truly matters - the bond between you and your dad.
